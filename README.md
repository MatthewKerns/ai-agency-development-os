# AI Agency Development OS

> **[Get Started: Setup and Installation Guide](docs/SETUP-AND-INSTALLATION.md)**

A [Claude Code Operating System](https://github.com/MatthewKerns/claude-code-os/) for running an AI automation agency. 


## Overview

AI Agency Development OS is a comprehensive system built on 13 core productivity principles, organized into 5 specialized departments designed to help you build and scale an AI automation agency to **$50k/month revenue**.

Built for the **Architect** - not a coder-for-hire, but the strategic leader who diagnoses, prototypes, scopes, prices, delegates, and manages.


### Core Philosophy

- **Entropy Principle**: Forget perfect. It will be messy. Nail the ONE thing that matters.
- **Zero Friction**: Remove barriers to create sustainable discipline
- **Spartan Rule**: Lean operations with brutal prioritization
- **Strategic Alignment**: Every action serves the $50k/mo OBG

## The Architect Role

| You ARE | You are NOT |
|---------|-------------|
| Diagnoser of business problems | A coder-for-hire |
| Prototyper (vibe coding) | A freelancer |
| Scoper and estimator | Someone who builds everything |
| Developer evaluator | Someone who grinds production |
| Margin protector | A service monkey |

**Your value = knowing what code is needed, who should build it, what it should cost, and ensuring it's done right.**

## The Agency Flow

```
1. Linh/Mikael bring lead
   ↓
2. You run diagnostic call (BILLABLE: $200-500/hr)
   ↓
3. You vibe code a prototype
   ↓
4. Client says YES → You scope and price
   ↓
5. You find/evaluate developer
   ↓
6. You add margin (dev cost + your margin + sales fee)
   ↓
7. You manage delivery to completion
   ↓
8. Collect payment → Repeat
```

## Priority Hierarchy

| Priority | Focus | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| P0 | Revenue (close deals, deliver, collect) | ACTIVE |
| P1 | Agency infrastructure (roles, splits, templates) | ACTIVE |
| P2 | Developer pipeline (recruit, evaluate) | Building |
| P3 | Developer Academy (long-term moat) | Foundation |
| P4 | Credibility assets (demos that close deals) | As needed |
| P5 | Content/inbound scaling | DEFERRED until OBG |

## Quick Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/daily-assessment [context]` | End of day productivity score |
| `/weekly-review [context]` | Weekly summary and planning |
| `/project-status` | Quick view of all projects |

## The Transformation

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Scattered AI sessions with no continuity | Integrated system with persistent memory |
| Manual planning taking 30+ minutes | 1-minute automated planning |
| Strategic drift and lost projects | Perfect strategic alignment |
| Freelancer mindset | Architect mindset with margin protection |

## OBG (One Big Goal)

**$50k/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months**

After achieving this, scale with YouTube content and inbound lead flow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review the [Setup and Installation Guide](docs/SETUP-AND-INSTALLATION.md)
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` for full context and instructions
4. Start with `claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/START_HERE.md`

## Key Reminders

1. **Charge for diagnostic calls** - $200-500/hr, no free discovery
2. **Prototype, don't build production** - Vibe code to validate
3. **Delegate production builds** - Recruit developers
4. **Protect margins** - Dev cost + your margin + sales fee
5. **Revenue first** - Everything else is secondary until $50k/mo × 3 months

## The Simple Rule

```
You are the Architect, not the builder.
Diagnose → Prototype → Scope → Price → Delegate → Manage → Collect
$50k/mo × 3 months → THEN scale with content.
```
