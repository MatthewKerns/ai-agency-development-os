# AI Agency Development OS

> **[Get Started: Setup and Installation Guide](docs/SETUP-AND-INSTALLATION.md)**

A [Claude Code Operating System](https://github.com/MatthewKerns/claude-code-os/) for running an AI automation agency.


## Overview

AI Agency Development OS is a comprehensive system built on 13 core productivity principles, organized into 5 specialized departments designed to help you build and scale an AI automation agency to **$50k/month revenue**.

Built for the **Architect** - not a coder-for-hire, but the strategic leader who diagnoses, prototypes, scopes, prices, delegates, and manages.

### Current Status (November 29, 2025)

**Active Projects:**
- **AntSavvy** - AI accounts assistant (P0: Close before Christmas)
- **Trevor** - Brand consultation automation (Delivery phase)
- **Linh** - Invoice automation / chatbot (Demo phase)

**Recent Enhancements:**
- Client project tracking system with dedicated folders
- LinkedIn content growth engine (3x/week publishing schedule)
- Fathom integration for meeting transcripts
- Developer Academy foundation (dev-coach submissions)
- Value-based pricing framework


### Core Philosophy

- **Entropy Principle**: Forget perfect. It will be messy. Nail the ONE thing that matters.
- **Zero Friction**: Remove barriers to create sustainable discipline
- **Spartan Rule**: Lean operations with brutal prioritization
- **Strategic Alignment**: Every action serves the $50k/mo OBG

## The Architect Role

| You ARE | You are NOT |
|---------|-------------|
| Diagnoser of business problems | A coder-for-hire |
| Prototyper (vibe coding) | A freelancer |
| Scoper and estimator | Someone who builds everything |
| Developer evaluator | Someone who grinds production |
| Margin protector | A service monkey |

**Your value = knowing what code is needed, who should build it, what it should cost, and ensuring it's done right.**

## The Agency Flow

```
1. Linh/Mikael bring lead
   ↓
2. You run diagnostic call (BILLABLE: $200-500/hr)
   ↓
3. You vibe code a prototype
   ↓
4. Client says YES → You scope and price
   ↓
5. You find/evaluate developer
   ↓
6. You add margin (dev cost + your margin + sales fee)
   ↓
7. You manage delivery to completion
   ↓
8. Collect payment → Repeat
```

## Priority Hierarchy

**See full roadmap:** [P1-P5 Strategic Roadmap](claude-code-os-implementation/02-operations/project-management/active-projects/antsavvy/ROADMAP-P1-P5.md)

| Priority | Focus | Timeline | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|
| P0 | Revenue (close deals, deliver, collect) | NOW | **[AntSavvy: Close by Dec 25](claude-code-os-implementation/02-operations/project-management/active-projects/antsavvy/P0-ACTIVE-NOW.md)** |
| P1 | Agency infrastructure (roles, splits, templates) | Jan-Feb 2026 | Building |
| P2 | Developer pipeline (recruit, evaluate) | Feb-Apr 2026 | Planning |
| P3 | Developer Academy ("I Code My Business") | Apr-Aug 2026 | Foundation |
| P4 | Credibility assets (demos, case studies) | Ongoing | Active |
| P5 | Content/inbound scaling (YouTube, SEO) | Sep 2026+ | DEFERRED until OBG |

## Quick Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/daily-assessment [context]` | End of day productivity score |
| `/weekly-review [context]` | Weekly summary and planning |
| `/project-status` | Quick view of all projects |

## Key Features

### Client Project Management
- **Dedicated project folders** with full context, meeting transcripts, and execution plans
- **Fathom integration** for automatic meeting note processing
- **Value-based pricing framework** (price on ROI, not hours)
- **P0-P5 priority system** ensuring revenue-first focus

### LinkedIn Content Engine
- **3x/week publishing schedule** (Mon/Wed/Fri)
- **Process documentation focus** teaching business owners to document requirements
- **NotebookLM integration** for infographic generation
- **Developer Academy content pipeline** (posts → process docs → curriculum)

### Developer Academy Foundation
- **"I Code My Business" vision** - training developers to interpret business processes
- **Dev-coach submissions** tracking potential academy instructors/students
- **Discord code sessions** for real-time problem-solving documentation
- **Network contacts system** for developer recruitment

### Strategic Alignment System
- **OBG tracking** toward $50k/mo × 3 months
- **Daily/weekly/monthly planning** agents and workflows
- **Architect role clarity** (diagnose, prototype, scope, delegate)
- **Margin protection standards** (50-70% target)

## The Transformation

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Scattered AI sessions with no continuity | Integrated system with persistent memory |
| Manual planning taking 30+ minutes | 1-minute automated planning |
| Strategic drift and lost projects | P0-P5 priority system with active deal tracking |
| Freelancer mindset | Architect mindset with value-based pricing |
| No content strategy | 3x/week LinkedIn publishing + Developer Academy pipeline |

## OBG (One Big Goal)

**$50k/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months**

After achieving this, scale with YouTube content and inbound lead flow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review the [Setup and Installation Guide](docs/SETUP-AND-INSTALLATION.md)
3. Read `CLAUDE.md` for full context and instructions
4. Start with `claude-code-os-implementation/01-executive-office/START_HERE.md`

## Key Reminders

1. **Charge for diagnostic calls** - $200-500/hr, no free discovery
2. **Prototype, don't build production** - Vibe code to validate
3. **Delegate production builds** - Recruit developers
4. **Protect margins** - Dev cost + your margin + sales fee
5. **Revenue first** - Everything else is secondary until $50k/mo × 3 months

---

## The Simple Rule

```
You are the Architect, not the builder.
Diagnose → Prototype → Scope → Price → Delegate → Manage → Collect
$50k/mo × 3 months → THEN scale with content.
```
