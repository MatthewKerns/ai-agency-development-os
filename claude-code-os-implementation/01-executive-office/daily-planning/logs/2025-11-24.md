# Daily Plan: 2025-11-24 (Sunday)

## OBG: $50k/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months

## THE ONE THING

**Complete Trevor $500 deliverable → Invoice → Cash in → Demo video → Next $1000 deliverable**

## Priority Stack

### Priority 1: Trevor Phase 1 - Complete & Invoice ($500)
**First $500 = Data storage + chatbot retrieval + page arrangement**

**Scope (per Fathom call):**
- ✅ Pages arranged as specified
- ✅ Text data stores on refresh
- ⏳ Chatbot retrieves and uses stored data

| Task | Time Est. | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Verify chatbot retrieves stored data properly | 1-2 hrs | IN PROGRESS |
| Set up separate repo with new Lovable project | 30-45 min | [ ] |
| Final testing and QA | 30 min | [ ] |
| Send invoice for $500 | 15 min | [ ] |

**Goal:** Complete by EOD tomorrow (11/25) → Scope Phase 3+ at $1000/chunk

**Why separate repo?** Agency best practices - client work isolated, clean demo environment, professional delivery

### Priority 2: Demo Video (After Delivery)
| Task | Time Est. | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Film Trevor demo video | 45-60 min | [ ] |
| Share with network for leads | 15 min | [ ] |

**Goal:** Use demo to generate work this week with upfront payment

### Priority 3: Trevor Phase 2 ($500) + Phase 3+ Planning
**Phase 2 scope (Second $500):**
- Chat thread history
- Improved PDF exports
- Updated privacy messaging
- Final walkthrough testing

**Phase 3+ strategy:**
- If P1 delivered by 11/25 → Scope additional features at $1000/chunk
- Increase chunk size = better hourly rate + faster cash flow

### Priority 4: DataAnnotation Work
| Task | Time Est. | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| DA work | 4-6 hrs | [ ] |

## Cash Flow Impact

| Action | Amount | Status |

| Trevor P1 Invoice | $500 | Complete → Invoice |
| Trevor P2 | $1000 | After P1 delivery |
| **Near-term cash** | **$1500** | **Priority 1** |

## Pipeline Status

|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Trevor P1 | $500 | Completing | Finish build → Invoice |
