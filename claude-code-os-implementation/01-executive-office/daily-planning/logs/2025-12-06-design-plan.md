### 2.2 New Philosophy Document
**Location:** `03-ai-growth-engine/development-framework/00-philosophy/architect-before-builder.md`

**Content:**
```markdown
# Architect Before Builder: The Transition Strategy

## The Core Insight

You can't be an effective Architect without first being a Builder.

### Why Building Now Matters

1. **Understanding True Time Involvement**
   - Can't estimate what you haven't done
   - Developers will overcharge if you don't know the work
   - No profit margin protection without cost knowledge

2. **Understanding True Cost**
   - Tool costs (Lovable, Make, Supabase, etc.)
   - Time per feature type
   - Complexity multipliers

3. **Quality Standards**
   - What "good" looks like
   - What corners get cut
   - What's worth paying more for

4. **Process Refinement**
   - Where things break
   - What documentation matters
   - How handoffs fail

## The Progression

### Phase 1: Builder Mode (Current)
- Build projects yourself
- Document everything
- Track time meticulously
- Note pain points and solutions
- Develop templates and standards

### Phase 2: Hybrid Mode (Soon)
- Build prototypes yourself
- Delegate production to developers
- Review and correct their work
- Refine estimation accuracy
- Build developer standards

### Phase 3: Architect Mode (Goal)
- Diagnose and prototype only
- Scope with confidence
- Price with margin protection
- Delegate all production
- Manage quality and delivery

## Key Metrics to Track While Building

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Hours per feature type | Estimation accuracy |
| Tool costs per project | Pricing floor |
| Bug density | Quality standards |
| Client revision rounds | Requirements quality |
| Time to deployment | Delivery expectations |

## The Rule

**Build enough to know what things should cost. Then delegate.**

Without this foundation:
- Developers overcharge → no margin
- Quality slips → reputation damage
- Estimates wrong → scope creep
- Handoffs fail → delivery delays
```

## PART 3: Priority Actions (What to Do TODAY)

Given your 2-hour window before 4pm:

### Tier 1: HIGH LEVERAGE (Do These)
1. **Film Scratch & Win Demo** (30-45 min)
   - Shows Eric your e-commerce capability
   - Reusable for other e-commerce leads

2. **Film Brand Coach Demo** (15-20 min)
   - Show local working version
   - Send to coaches for review
   - Prerequisite for Richard call

### Tier 2: QUICK WINS (If Time)
3. **Launch Infinity Vault** (15 min if ready)
4. **Schedule Richard call** (5 min - email/DM)

### Tier 3: DEFER (Not Today)
- Morning Brew video → schedule for LA trip downtime
- AAA trainings → schedule for next week
- Development workflow docs → longer session needed
