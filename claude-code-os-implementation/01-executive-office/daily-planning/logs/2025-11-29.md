## Key Reminders

- **Fathom integration is the breaking constraint** - Unlocks Christian/Turtle project + agency workflow
- **Trevor payment is processing** - Track it, but don't block on it
- **Development coach call is critical** - Need cost estimation framework before pricing Christian/Turtle
- **Equity partners have client list** - Fathom workflow makes discovery systematic
- **Build prototypes, not production** - Prove value first, then delegate production builds

---

## Architect Role Check

Today I am:
- [x] Diagnosing (Christian/Turtle company needs)
- [x] Prototyping (Fathom integration, LinkedIn automation)
- [x] Scoping (Christian/Turtle project)
- [ ] Delegating (Not yet - building prototypes first)
- [x] Learning (Development coach call for cost estimation)

**This is appropriate because:**
- Fathom integration is a new capability (prototype to prove value)
- Christian/Turtle is new project (scope before delegating)
- Cost estimation framework is foundational (learning to price better)

**Next phase (after prototypes work):**
- Scope Christian/Turtle with confidence
- Price with proper margins
- Delegate production builds
- Manage delivery
