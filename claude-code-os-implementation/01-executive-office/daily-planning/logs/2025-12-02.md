## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Phased delivery model:** Collect progressively, reduce risk for client
2. **Clear deliverables:** Trevor knew exactly what Phase 2 included
3. **Payment on delivery:** No invoice delays, immediate payment
4. **Professional handoff:** Testing completed, demo ready, client confident

### What to Improve
1. **Phase 3 scoping earlier:** Should have Phase 3 proposal ready before Phase 2 delivery
2. **Maintain pipeline momentum:** Always have next phase pre-scoped
3. **Clear timeline expectations:** Set dates for review/decision on Phase 3

### What to Replicate
1. **$500 phase chunks:** Sweet spot for client cash flow and value delivery
2. **Testing before delivery:** Professional QA prevents post-delivery issues
3. **Clear follow-up plan:** Trevor knows his action items, I know mine
