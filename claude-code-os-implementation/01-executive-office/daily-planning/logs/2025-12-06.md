## Strategic Insight of the Day

**Why I need to do development work now:**

The long-term vision is the Architect role, but I can't skip the building phase:

1. **Understanding true time involvement** - Can't estimate what I haven't done
2. **Understanding true cost** - Know what to pay developers
3. **Calling out overcharges** - Developers can't inflate if I know the work
4. **Protecting profit margins** - No margin without cost knowledge
5. **Operating successfully as Architect** - Can't manage what I haven't built

**The key:** Build systems, refine processes, understand current tools → Then delegate effectively

**Development workflow to build out:**
- Requirements gathering and refinement
- Design and implementation
- Testing and validation
- Prompt refinement
- User feedback integration
- Maintenance protocols

## Notes

**Bank stop required** - Part of today's logistics

**Context for demos:**
- Eric needs to see what I can do
- Coaches need to review Brand Coach before Richard call
- Demo videos = credibility assets that close deals
- This is the gateway to getting paid for development work
