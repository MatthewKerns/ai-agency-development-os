## PRIORITY 1: Trial Run Approach (Trent's Proposal)

**Key Principle:** Trial run WITHOUT cementing equity splits into the future. Test how we work together first.

**What We Need to Agree On Today:**

1. **Initial Project Equity Split**
   - How do we split earnings on first project?
   - Based on what (contribution, time, role, risk)?
   - Document agreement for this project only

2. **Work Required & Sprint Organization**
   - What work does each partner own?
   - How do we organize this sprint and future sprints?
   - Quality bar expectations (high quality delivery)

3. **Automation Gaps to Cover**
   - Onboarding automation
   - Customer experience automation
   - Build as we deliver the first project

4. **Phased Results Delivery**
   - Agree on project workflow (see below)
   - Define what constitutes "Phase 1", "Phase 2", etc.
   - Payment milestones
