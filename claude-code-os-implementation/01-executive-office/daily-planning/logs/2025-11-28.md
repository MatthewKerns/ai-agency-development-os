   - Based on what (contribution, time, role, risk)?
   - Document agreement for this project only

2. **Work Required & Sprint Organization**
   - What work does each partner own?
   - How do we organize this sprint and future sprints?
   - Quality bar expectations (high quality delivery)

3. **Automation Gaps to Cover**
   - Onboarding automation
   - Customer experience automation
   - Build as we deliver the first project

4. **Phased Results Delivery**
   - Agree on project workflow (see below)

- What are payment milestones?

---

### Part 4: Potential Role Splits for First Project

**Option A: By Expertise**
- **Mekaiel & Chris:** Discovery, sales, client management, onboarding
- **Trent:** Developer hiring, assessment, onboarding, technical validation
- **Matthew:** Prototyping, company OS integration, quality assurance, client demos

**Option B: By Project Phase**

- **Developer Management (Trent):** Phase 5
- **Implementation (Trent + Matthew):** Phase 6
- **Client Delivery (All):** Phases 7-8

**Option C: Hybrid**
- **Client-facing (Mekaiel/Chris):** Discovery, sales, demos, payment collection
- **Technical (Matthew/Trent):** Prototype, dev selection, build oversight, QA
- **Shared:** AAA coach meetings, phase planning, automation building

**Open Discussion:** What makes most sense?

---

### Part 5: Pricing Strategy & Margin Structure (~20 min)

**Core Pricing Questions:**

1. **How to Price the First Project**
   - Discovery call pricing: $200-500/hr (billable diagnostic)
   - Prototype phase: Fixed price or hourly?
   - Developer costs + margin calculation
   - AAA coaching time (included or separate line item?)

2. **Margin Structure**
   ```
   CLIENT PRICE
   - Developer cost (actual)
   - Agency margin (covers: mgmt, QA, risk, coordination)
   - Sales commission (Mekaiel/Chris share)
   - Equity partner split (on net after dev cost)
   ```

3. **Example Pricing Scenario**
   ```
   Client pays: $5,000
   Developer cost: $2,000
   Gross margin: $3,000

   Split options to discuss:
   - Sales commission (10-20%): $300-600
   - Remaining to split among equity partners: $2,400-2,700
   ```

4. **Phased Delivery Pricing**
   - Phase 1: 40-50% upfront (covers prototype + initial build)
   - Phase 2: 30-40% mid-project (after Phase 1 demo)
   - Phase 3: 20% final payment (completion & handoff)

   OR simpler:
   - 50% upfront (covers discovery, prototype, Phase 1)
   - 50% on completion (Phase 2+)

5. **Cost Breakdown Components**
   - Discovery call time: ____ hours @ $____/hr
   - Prototype time: ____ hours @ $____/hr
   - AAA coach meetings: $____ (included in project or separate?)
   - Developer selection: ____ hours @ $____/hr
   - Developer cost: $____
   - QA/Testing time: ____ hours @ $____/hr
   - Client demos/delivery: ____ hours @ $____/hr
   - **Total cost:** $____
   - **Client price (with margin):** $____
   - **Margin:** $____ or ____%

6. **Developer Cost Management**
   - How to find developer rates (research phase)
   - Typical dev rates: $30-150/hr depending on skill/location
   - Fixed price vs hourly for developers
   - Managing scope creep with fixed-price dev contracts

**Pricing Strategy Options:**

**Option A: Fixed Price Per Phase**
- Client gets fixed price quote upfront
- We manage developer costs internally
- Higher margin potential, higher risk

**Option B: Cost-Plus Pricing**
- Transparent: "Dev costs $X, our management fee is $Y"
- Lower margin, lower risk
- Builds trust through transparency

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Discovery/Prototype: Fixed price
- Implementation: Cost-plus with margin
- Balance between risk and trust

**Questions to Decide:**
- What's our target margin %? (Industry standard: 30-50%)
- Do we show dev costs to client or keep internal?
- How do we handle dev cost overruns?
- What's included in "agency management fee"?
- How do we split profits among equity partners on first project?

**Example First Project Pricing:**

```
DISCOVERY & PROTOTYPE PHASE
- Discovery call (2 hrs): $400
- AAA coach strategy session: $200
- Prototype build (10 hrs): $1,000
- Client refinement (5 hrs): $500
Subtotal: $2,100

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
- Developer selection (5 hrs): $500
- Developer cost (estimated): $2,500
- QA & testing (8 hrs): $800
- Client demo & delivery (3 hrs): $300
Subtotal: $4,100

TOTAL PROJECT: $6,200
Payment structure: $3,100 upfront | $3,100 on completion
```

**Profit Split Discussion:**
- Gross margin after dev costs: $3,700
- How to split among Mekaiel, Chris, Trent, Matthew?
- Based on time contribution? Equal split? Role-weighted?

---
