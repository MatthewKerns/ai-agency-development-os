## Notes

**Network Contacts System:**
This solves the "who do I know that can help?" problem. Every week after networking, update the database. Over time, build a powerful network indexed by skills.

**Strategic Alignment:**
- Networking → Leads → Revenue (P0)
- Developer contacts → Delegation capability (P2)
- Business owner contacts → Client pipeline (P0)

## End of Day Check

- [x] Did I make progress toward $50k/mo OBG?
  - ✅ Built networking system for sustainable lead flow
  - ✅ Attended event, made connections
- [x] Did I move Trevor project forward?
  - ⏸️ On deck for tomorrow
- [x] Did I build something that reduces friction?
  - ✅ Network contacts system makes networking systematic

## Reflection

Built critical infrastructure today. The Network Contacts system turns random networking into a strategic asset. Every person I meet is now searchable by skill and indexed for future opportunities.

Tomorrow: Execute on the connections made today. Send messages, log contacts, and close Trevor P1.
