| Demo videos not filmed | High | Block specific time, no excuses |

---

## Architect Reminders

```
1. Don't build production code - prototype only
2. Charge for diagnostic calls ($200-500/hr)
3. Protect margins (dev cost + your margin + sales fee)
4. Revenue first, everything else second
5. Cash in hand > Demos without payment
6. Close what's in front of you first
```

---

## Daily Questions to Ask

1. Did I move a deal forward today?
2. Did I act as Architect or coder?
3. Is there money I should be collecting?
4. What's blocking closes and how do I remove it?
5. Did I guarantee some income with DA?
