## THE ONE THING

**Send EU event connection messages + Complete Trevor P1 → Invoice $500**

## Priority Stack

### Priority 1: EU Networking Event Follow-up (REVENUE IMPACT)
**Goal:** Convert networking contacts into business opportunities

| Send personalized connection messages | 45-60 min | [ ] |
| Add follow-up reminders to calendar | 10 min | [ ] |

**Why This Matters:**

## Strategic Alignment

**How does today move me toward $50k/mo?**

1. **EU Event Follow-up (P0 - Revenue)**
   - Builds pipeline of potential clients
   - Establishes network for future deals
   - Creates warm leads for diagnostic calls

2. **Trevor P1 Invoice (P0 - Revenue)**
   - $500 cash in
   - Proven delivery = trust for P2 ($1000)
   - Demo asset for future clients

3. **Network Contacts System (P1 - Infrastructure)**
   - Systematic networking = sustainable lead flow
   - Skills database = delegation capability
   - Compounds every week

---

## Key Reminders

1. **Connection messages must be personal** - Reference specific conversation
2. **Charge for diagnostic calls** - $200-500/hr when EU contacts ask for help
3. **Trevor P1 = prove delivery** - Quality here = easier P2 sale
4. **Demo video = credibility asset** - Use to close future deals
