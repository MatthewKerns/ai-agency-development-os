## End of Day Check

**Revenue Priority:**
- [ ] Did I complete Trevor session history feature?
- [ ] Did I deploy to test users?
- [ ] Did I send the $500 invoice?
- [ ] Is Linh automation working in production?

**Pipeline Priority:**
- [ ] Did I follow up with all networking contacts?
- [ ] Did I post at least one credibility asset?
- [ ] Did I text Linh with update?

**Architect Check:**
- [ ] Did I act as Architect (diagnose, prototype, manage) or get lost in coding?
- [ ] Did I protect time for revenue-generating work?

## Notes Section

### Tonight's Focus (Nov 25)
- Make progress on brand coach session history
- Get ahead on core feature so tomorrow is deploy + invoice

### Reminders
- **Block 10 AM-1 PM for deep work** - no meetings, no distractions
- Session history = last technical blocker before invoice
- Demo video = credibility asset that generates leads
- Post content = visibility without spending on ads
- DA work is backup, not priority (Trevor = faster $/hr)

## Success Metrics for Today

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Trevor MVP deployed | ✅ | Enables $500 invoice |
| Invoice sent | ✅ | Cash in < 7 days |
| Demo video filmed | ✅ | Credibility asset |
| 4 networking follow-ups | ✅ | Pipeline building |
| Production validation (Linh) | ✅ | Deliverable complete |

## Strategic Alignment Check

✅ **P0 (Revenue):** Trevor completion → $500 invoice
✅ **P1 (Agency Infrastructure):** Following up networking contacts
✅ **P4 (Credibility):** Demo videos + content posts
⏸️ **P5 (Content/Inbound):** Deferred until after OBG

**This plan aligns with:** Architect role, revenue priority, margin protection, credibility building

## Energy Management

**High-energy blocks:**
- Morning networking + follow-ups (social energy)
- Mid-morning deep work (technical focus)

**Medium-energy blocks:**
- Afternoon testing + validation
- Demo video filming

**Low-energy blocks:**
- Content posting
- DA work (if needed)

**Strategy:** Do technical work before lunch, creative work after lunch, admin work in gaps
