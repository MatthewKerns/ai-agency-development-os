**Most business owners either over-document (50-page manuals developers skim) or under-document ("here's what I need" bullet points that leave too much to interpretation).**

Here's the framework that hits the sweet spot:

**The 5-Step Process Documentation Framework**

**1. NAME the Process**
Clear name = shared language
❌ "Customer thing"
✅ "Follow-up Automation Based on Engagement Level"

**2. DEFINE the Trigger**
What event starts this process?
• Time-based: "Every Monday at 9am"
• Action-based: "When customer submits form"
• Threshold-based: "When inventory <10 units"

**3. MAP the Workflow**
Every step from trigger to completion.
Numbered steps. Clear actions. Decision points.
(This is what the developer actually builds)

**4. HANDLE Edge Cases**
The "what if" scenarios:
• What if customer is already a client?
• What if they opted out?
• What if data is missing?
(Edge cases = where bugs live. Document upfront.)

**5. SPECIFY Success Criteria**
Two parts:
• Technical: Did it run without errors?
• Business: Did it achieve the goal?

**Time investment:** 30-60 minutes per process

**Result:** Developers build it right the first time because scope is crystal clear.

This framework is what we teach in the Developer Academy—helping business owners document processes that developers can actually build from.

What part of process documentation do you struggle with most?

**Infographic Points for NotebookLM:**
(Input process doc sections: "The 5-Step Framework" overview + visual template example)

Visual should show:
- The 5 steps as a vertical flow or circular process
- Each step with 1-2 line description and icon
- Example snippet for each step (brief)
- Time investment callout: "30-60 minutes"
- Result callout: "Built right the first time"
