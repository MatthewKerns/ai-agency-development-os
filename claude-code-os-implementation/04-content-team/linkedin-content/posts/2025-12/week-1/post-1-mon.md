**Your developers are guessing. Here's why:**

You hire a developer with a crystal-clear vision. "I need a CRM that tracks customer touchpoints and triggers follow-ups based on engagement." Simple.

Then you spend $5-15k in extra development costs because what they built isn't quite right. Not because they're bad developers—because your process lived in your head, not in a document.

**Here's what changes when you document first:**

→ You clarify your own thinking. "When a customer engages" becomes specific, trackable events—not interpretations.

→ Developers know exactly what to build. No more guessing between email opens, page visits, or cart abandons.

→ You get it right the first time. 80-90% accurate on V1 instead of 40-50%.

**Real numbers:** One documented process saved a client $4,500 and 2 weeks by eliminating 3 rounds of rebuilds.

**The truth?** Every hour documenting your process saves 10 hours of development time.

Not because developers are slow. Because clarity eliminates guesswork, reduces rebuilds, and ensures they build what you actually need.

**Your process doc isn't "extra work before development." It's the work that makes development successful.**

What's your biggest challenge when working with developers?

**Infographic Points for NotebookLM:**
(Input process doc section: "Why Documentation Changes Everything" + "Real-World Example")

Visual should show:
- Problem flow: Verbal explanation → Interpretation → Rebuild cycle ($4,500 wasted)
- Solution flow: Process doc → Clear spec → Built right first time ($4,500 saved)
- Key stat: "1 hour documenting = 10 hours saved in development"
