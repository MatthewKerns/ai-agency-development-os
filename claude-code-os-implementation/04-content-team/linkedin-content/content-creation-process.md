## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Running out of topic ideas
**Solution:** Review client pain points, network contacts insights, market trends from AUTOMATION-TYPES-MASTER-LIST.md

**Problem:** Posts not getting engagement
**Solution:** Review hooks, ensure speaking to business owners not developers, add more specific examples

**Problem:** Process docs taking too long
**Solution:** Use existing frameworks from this project, extract from real client work, start with templates

**Problem:** Infographics look unprofessional
**Solution:** Simplify design, focus on clarity over aesthetics, use NotebookLM templates
