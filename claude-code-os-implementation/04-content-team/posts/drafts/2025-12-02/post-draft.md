## LinkedIn Caption

**Hook:**
We almost locked ourselves into a bad partnership structure.

**Body:**
Last Friday, four of us sat down to discuss equity splits for our AI automation agency.

The easy move: Cement percentages now. Lock it in. Move forward.

But Trent said something that changed everything:

"What if we do a trial run first?"

Instead of committing to long-term equity splits, we agreed:
- Split earnings on the FIRST project only
- See how we actually work together
- Test the delivery framework in real conditions
- Re-evaluate after we've shipped something real

**Why this matters:**

Most partnerships fail because people commit before they know how they work together.

You think you know:
- Who does what work
- How decisions get made
- Who shows up when it's hard
- What "high quality" means to each person

But you don't. Not until you've delivered something real together.

**Our trial run framework:**
1. One project, one equity split (just for this project)
2. Define roles and ownership clearly
3. Set quality bar expectations upfront
4. Deliver the project together
5. Reconvene: Does this partnership work?

If yes → Define longer-term structure
If no → Part ways professionally, no hard feelings

**The lesson:**
Don't commit to marriage on the first date.

Test the relationship before you lock in equity, roles, or long-term structure.

Your future self will thank you.

**CTA:**
Building or joining an agency? How are you structuring the partnership? Have you considered a trial run?

## Engagement Strategy

**Questions to spark comments:**
- "Have you ever regretted a partnership structure?"
- "What's your approach to equity splits in new ventures?"
- "Trial run or commit upfront - which makes more sense to you?"

**Reply templates:**
- "How long should a trial run be?" → "One project, start to finish. Long enough to see how you work together under real delivery pressure."
- "What if someone doesn't want a trial?" → "Red flag. If they can't handle testing the relationship first, they're not thinking long-term."
