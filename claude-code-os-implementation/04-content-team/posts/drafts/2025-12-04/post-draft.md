## LinkedIn Caption

**Hook:**
I sent Trevor my bank account details this morning.

Sounds small. But it's a milestone.

**Body:**
A year ago, I would've thought:
"Just send an invoice, they'll figure out how to pay."

Now I think:
"Remove every friction point between client and payment."

**Here's what changed:**

OLD APPROACH:
- Send invoice
- Wait for client to ask payment method
- "Venmo? Zelle? Check?"
- Back and forth, delayed payment
- Friction = slow cash flow

NEW APPROACH:
- Invoice includes bank details upfront
- ACH transfer (direct bank-to-bank)
- Professional, simple, fast
- Client pays immediately
- No payment processor fees

**Why this matters:**

When you're a freelancer, you think: "Invoice sent = job done"

When you're a business owner, you think: "Payment received = job done"

Every day between invoice and payment is:
- Cash flow delayed
- Mental overhead (did they forget?)
- Risk of payment issues

**The shift:**
Optimize the ENTIRE revenue cycle, not just delivery.

Small changes compound:
- Bank details in invoice → 2-3 days faster payment
- Payment reminders automated → Zero mental overhead
- Professional payment options → Client confidence

**The lesson:**
Your payment process is part of your product.

Make it frictionless.
Make it professional.
Make it fast.

**CTA:**
What's one friction point in your payment process? How can you remove it this week?

- RIGHT: "New way" - streamlined, fast payment (single arrow)
- Visual metaphor of removing obstacles

**Option 2: Payment Timeline Comparison**
- BEFORE: Invoice → Questions → Back & forth → Payment (7-10 days)
- AFTER: Invoice with details → Payment (2-3 days)
- Timeline graphic showing speed improvement

**Brand Aesthetic:**
- Business operations focus
- Professional, clean design
- Speed/efficiency emphasized

## Engagement Strategy

**Questions to spark comments:**
- "What's your payment process? Invoice-only or details upfront?"
- "What payment method do you prefer for client work?"
- "Have you ever had a client delay payment? What happened?"

**Reply templates:**
- "Don't bank details feel unprofessional?" → "Opposite. It shows you run a real business. Stripe/PayPal take 3-5%. ACH is free and faster."
- "What about payment security?" → "Use invoice + bank details. Same as any B2B payment. Been standard for decades."
