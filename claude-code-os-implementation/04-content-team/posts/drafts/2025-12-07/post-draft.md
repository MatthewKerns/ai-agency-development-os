## LinkedIn Caption

**Hook:**
Yesterday I met an e-commerce operator from the UK who wants to partner.

**Body:**
Here's what made the conversation interesting:

He's building relationships with e-commerce sellers.
I build automations that help e-commerce sellers.

He likes building but doesn't want to do everything himself.
I'm the same way.

**The opportunity:**
He brings the deals. I build the systems. We both win.

**What I showed him:**
A "Scratch & Win" customer engagement automation I built for my own e-commerce company:

1. **The trigger:** Insert card in every package with QR code
2. **The capture:** Customer scans → lands on prize wheel
3. **The automation:** Make.com workflow captures data, picks prize, sends discount
4. **The storage:** Google Sheets logs every customer + their preferences
5. **The retention:** Brand referral bonus program for repeat purchases

Total cost: ~$0.10 per card + automation tools
Value: Customer database, email list, repeat purchases, referral engine

**The insight:**
Most e-commerce brands ship products and hope customers come back.

Smart brands turn every shipment into a data capture + engagement opportunity.

**The next step:**
I'm filming a full demo video this week showing exactly how this works.

If you run e-commerce and want to see how to turn insert cards into a customer engagement system, drop a comment and I'll share it when it's ready.

**The bigger picture:**
This is what building an agency looks like in real-time:
- Find operators who need what you build
- Show proof of what you've already done
- Create partnerships where everyone wins

Sales + Development = Agency.

**CTA:**
Anyone else exploring agency partnerships? What's working for you?
