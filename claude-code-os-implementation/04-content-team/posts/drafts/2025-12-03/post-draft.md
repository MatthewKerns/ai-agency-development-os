## LinkedIn Caption

**Hook:**
I identified the ONE integration that unlocks $10k+ in agency revenue.

**Body:**
Friday morning, I mapped out every project in our pipeline:
- Trevor's brand consultation tool (active)
- Christian's company rescue project (new)
- Equity partners' client discovery workflow (starting)

Every single one had the same bottleneck:

**Meeting notes.**

Right now, every client meeting means:
- 2-hour discovery session
- 30-60 minutes manually processing notes
- Another 30 minutes organizing into our system
- Action items buried in transcripts
- Context lost between meetings

That's 1-2 hours of manual work per meeting.
With 5-10 client meetings per week, that's 5-20 hours burned.

**The solution: Fathom OS integration**

Meeting ends → Fathom webhook fires → AI processes transcript → OS automatically:
- Extracts action items
- Identifies pain points mentioned
- Creates project files in the right folders
- Summarizes key insights
- Tags automation opportunities

30 seconds vs 60 minutes per meeting.
That's 100x faster.

**This unlocks:**
1. Christian's rescue project (needs meeting tracking)
2. Systematic client discovery (equity partners can run 10 sessions/week)
3. No more lost action items from client calls

**The lesson:**
Every agency has ONE integration that's the breaking constraint.

Find yours. Build it (or pay to build it). Scale everything after.

For us, it's automated meeting processing.
What's yours?

- AFTER: Automated processing (30 sec) - AI workflow graphic
- Bold time difference highlighted

**Option 2: Bottleneck Breaking Visual**
- Pipeline with bottleneck shown
- Fathom integration breaking through bottleneck
- Flow resuming after automation
- Clean, technical aesthetic

**Brand Aesthetic:**
- Technical, automation-focused
- Before/after clarity
- Time savings emphasized

## Engagement Strategy

**Questions to spark comments:**
- "What's the most time-consuming manual process in your agency?"
- "Have you automated meeting notes? What tool do you use?"
- "What's YOUR breaking constraint right now?"

**Reply templates:**
- "How does Fathom integration work?" → "Fathom records meeting + transcript. Webhook fires when meeting ends. Our server receives transcript, Claude AI extracts action items/pain points, writes to OS automatically."
- "What other meeting tools work?" → "Any with webhook support - Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, etc. Key is automated processing, not just recording."
