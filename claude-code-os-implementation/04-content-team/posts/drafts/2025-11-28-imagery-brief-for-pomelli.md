# Imagery Brief for Pomelli - Post #1 (Nov 28)

**Post Topic:** Developer → Agency Builder mindset shift (hourly thinking vs outcome thinking)
**Post Date:** 2025-11-28
**Series:** Thursday - Developer → Agency Builder

---

## Visual Concept

**Core Message:** The mental shift from selling hours to selling business outcomes

**Primary Visual Need:** Simple, clean comparison graphic showing the transition

---

## Option 1: Before/After Split Screen

**Left Side (Before - Developer Mindset):**
- Icon: Clock or stopwatch
- Text: "8 hours × $100/hr = $800"
- Subtext: "Am I charging enough?"
- Visual style: Muted, uncertain, calculating

**Right Side (After - Agency Builder Mindset):**
- Icon: Target/bullseye or upward graph
- Text: "30-40 hrs saved/month = $3k-5k value"
- Subtext: "Charging $1,000 for outcome"
- Visual style: Confident, clear, outcome-focused

**Design Notes:**
- Clean split down the middle
- Arrow pointing from left to right showing transition
- Use brand colors (from business DNA)
- Simple icons, not cluttered
- Readable text at mobile size

---

## Option 2: Journey/Timeline Graphic

**Visual Flow (Left to Right):**

1. **Developer Thinking (Left)**
   - "How many hours?"
   - "What's my rate?"
   - Icon: Clock/calculator

2. **Transition Arrow (Middle)**
   - Text: "The Shift"
   - Small moment of realization icon

3. **Agency Builder Thinking (Right)**
   - "What problem am I solving?"
   - "What's the business value?"
   - Icon: Lightbulb/target

**Design Notes:**
- Horizontal flow
- Progressive story
- Visual metaphor of journey
- Clean, minimal

---

## Option 3: Simple Text Comparison

**Format:** Two-column comparison

**Left Column:**
```
OLD THINKING
❌ Hours × Rate
❌ "Am I charging enough?"
❌ Selling time
```

**Right Column:**
```
NEW THINKING
✅ Business Outcome
✅ "What's this worth?"
✅ Selling value
```

**Design Notes:**
- Clean typography
- X vs checkmark visual
- Brand colors
- White space
- Mobile-friendly

---

## Option 4: Phased Delivery Visual

**Concept:** Show the phased approach as part of the mindset shift

**Visual Layout:**
```
Phase 1: $500
[Working MVP icon]
↓
Client tests & validates
↓
Phase 2: $500
[Production-ready icon]

Total Value: $3k-5k/month saved
Total Cost: $1,000
ROI: 3-5x
```

**Design Notes:**
- Vertical flow showing progression
- Dollar amounts clear and prominent
- ROI calculation visible
- Shows risk reduction through phasing
