**Hook:**
I nearly made a $500 mistake this weekend.

**Body:**
I was about to scope Phase 3 of a client project at $500.

Then I looked at the actual feature list:
- Beta paywall + Stripe integration
- Advanced export options (Gamma/Google Docs)
- Training videos UI + full onboarding
- Beta tester system + feedback collection
- NotebookLM integration + AI-powered pre-fill
- Hosting cost optimization

That's not $500 of value. That's easily $1,000+.

Here's what changed my thinking:

OLD MINDSET: "How many hours will this take? × my rate = price"
NEW MINDSET: "What's the business outcome worth to the client?"

Phase 3 enables Trevor to:
- Launch his beta to paying customers (paywall)
- Export professional deliverables (advanced exports)
- Onboard users smoothly (training videos)
- Gather feedback systematically (beta tester system)
- Scale with AI automation (NotebookLM)

This isn't about my time. It's about unlocking his revenue.

**The shift every developer needs to make:**
Stop pricing your hours. Start pricing the business outcome.

Your client doesn't care about your 20 hours of work.
They care about the $10k/month they'll make from the feature you built.

Price accordingly.

**CTA:**
Have you made this shift yet? What's holding you back from outcome-based pricing?

## Visual Concept (Imagery Brief for Pomelli)

**Option 1: Before/After Split Screen (Priority)**
- LEFT: "Hours × Rate = Price" (developer mindset) - dim/confined aesthetic
- RIGHT: "Business Outcome = Value" (agency owner mindset) - bright/expansive aesthetic
- Center divider with arrow showing transition

**Option 2: Feature Value Breakdown**
- Visual showing features stacked up with value amounts
- Bottom shows "$500? No." / Top shows "$1,000+ value"
- Clean, modern design with emphasis on value calculation

**Brand Aesthetic:**
- Developer-focused (clean, minimal, technical)
- Professional but not corporate
- 1200×627px for LinkedIn feed optimization

## Engagement Strategy

**Questions to spark comments:**
- "What's your current pricing model - hourly or outcome-based?"
- "What's stopping you from charging based on value?"
- "Have you ever underpriced a project? What did you learn?"

**Reply templates:**
- "How do you calculate outcome value?" → "I look at time saved, revenue enabled, or costs reduced. If my feature saves 40hrs/month at $100/hr value, that's $4k/month value. I price a fraction of that."
- "What if client won't pay for outcomes?" → "Then they're not your ideal client. Find clients who understand business value, not just development hours."
