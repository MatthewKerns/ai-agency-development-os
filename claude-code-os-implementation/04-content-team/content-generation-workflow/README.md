## Quick Start

**You're Already Doing Step 1:**
- Daily planning logs in `/01-executive-office/daily-planning/logs/`
- These are your content source material

**To Generate Content:**
1. Read a daily log (e.g., `2025-11-28.md`)
2. Ask: "Generate LinkedIn post from this day's log"
3. Agent creates draft in `/posts/drafts/`
4. Create imagery brief for Pomelli
5. Review, refine, get visual
6. Publish

**Process:**
- One post at a time (not batching 5 posts)
- Refine the process as we go
- Build imagery template with Pomelli
- Track what resonates

## Example Daily Log → Post Flow

**Daily Log (Thu - Nov 28):**
- Trevor client demo prep at 7:30am
- Phased delivery: $500 Phase 1 + $500 Phase 2
- Sent bank account details for professional payments
- Mindset shift: Hourly rate → Business outcome value

**Agent Generates (Thu - Developer → Agency Builder Series):**
- Hook: "I had my first 'agency owner' moment this morning"
- Story: Client demo prep, pricing transition
- Before/after: Hourly thinking vs outcome thinking
- Lesson: Phased delivery, value-based pricing
- CTA: "What's stopping you from pricing based on value?"

**Imagery Brief Created:**
- 4 visual options for Pomelli
- Priority: Before/After split screen comparison
- Brand-aligned, developer-focused aesthetic

**Result:**
- Post draft ready
- Waiting on visual from Pomelli
- Will publish once complete
