## DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS

**Known Dependencies:**
- Business DNA must be complete before Gamma theme (DNA → Theme)
- Daily summaries needed before content pipeline test (Summaries → Posts)

**Potential Blockers:**
- LinkedIn recommendation response time (mitigate: send early in week)
- Gamma learning curve (mitigate: watch tutorials, use AI assist)
- Daily summary discipline (mitigate: calendar reminder, make it easy)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Front-load LinkedIn and DNA work (Mon-Wed)
- Keep content pipeline simple initially (iterate later)
- Use Gamma AI heavily (don't overthink design)

---

## NEXT WEEK PREVIEW

**Week of Dec 9:**
- Publish 5 LinkedIn posts from content pipeline
- Create first Academy curriculum outline using Gamma
- Begin AntSavvy project deliverables
- Refine content pipeline based on Week 1 learnings

---

## RESOURCES NEEDED

- [x] LinkedIn (existing)
- [ ] Gamma.app account
- [x] Canva (for banner design, if needed)
- [x] Claude Code (for content agent)
- [ ] LinkedIn scheduling tool (Buffer/Hootsuite/native)

**Templates:**
- [ ] Daily summary template (create this week)
- [ ] Post templates for each series (create this week)
- [ ] Business DNA template (create this week)
- [ ] Gamma slide templates (create this week)

**Time:**
- Total: ~15-20 hours this week
- Daily: 3-4 hours/day
- Front-loaded Mon-Wed (heavier lifting)
- Lighter Thu-Fri (refinement and testing)

---
