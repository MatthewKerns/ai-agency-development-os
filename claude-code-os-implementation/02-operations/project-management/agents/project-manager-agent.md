## Key Questions to Answer

1. How many demos are published? (Target: 10)
2. How many have quantified results? (Target: 5+)
3. What's blocking the next demo?
4. Is client work progressing?
5. Are we on track for monthly targets?

## Monthly Targets Reference

| Month | Target | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|------------|
| November 2025 | 2 demos (Linh, Trevor) | 2 |
| December 2025 | 4 demos (lead-driven) | 6 |
| January 2026 | 4 demos (lead-driven) | 10 |

## Red Flags to Surface

- No demo progress for 1+ week
- Client project stalled
- Missing baseline metrics
- No coaching calls scheduled
- Working on non-demo projects
- Lead flow work before demos exist
