## Key Questions to Answer

1. How much revenue collected MTD? (Target: $50k)
2. What's the pipeline value? (Target: 2-3x monthly = $100k+)
3. What's blocking the next delivery?
4. Are payments being collected?
5. Do we have enough developers for active projects?

## Monthly Revenue Targets

| Month | Target | Cumulative OBG Progress |
|-------|--------|-------------------------|
| Current | $50k | /3 consecutive |
| Next | $50k | /3 consecutive |
| Next +1 | $50k | /3 consecutive |

**OBG Achievement = 3 consecutive months at $50k+**

## Red Flags to Surface

- Revenue below $25k by mid-month
- No new proposals for 2+ weeks
- Payment collection delays
- Developer capacity maxed out
- Projects without assigned developers
- Architect building production code (should delegate)
- Free diagnostic calls (should bill $200-500/hr)
- Low margins (<30%) on projects
