### Phased Delivery Value Proposition for Trevor

**Why Phased Delivery Works for Trevor:**

1. **Lower Risk** - Test Phase 1 before committing to full build
2. **Cash Flow Friendly** - $500-1000 chunks vs $5000 upfront
3. **Iterative Feedback** - Refine as we go based on real usage
4. **Scale as Needed** - Only pay for what you actually use
5. **Immediate Value** - Get Phase 1 working while Phase 2 builds

**Revenue Projection for Agency:**
```
Phase 1: $500 (Invoiced Nov 28)
Phase 2: $500 (Target: Dec 9-13)
Phase 3: $1000 (Target: Dec 16-20)
Phase 4: $1000 (Target: Jan 6-10)
Phase 5: $1000 (Target: Jan 20-24)
────────────────────────────────
Total: $4000 over 2-3 months
Monthly: ~$1500-2000
```

**Margin Strategy:**
- Self-built: 100% margin
- Time investment: ~20-30 hours total
- Hourly equivalent: ~$133-200/hr
- Prototype → Production transition: Delegate Phase 4+ to developer

---

### Architect Role Transition Plan

**Current (Phases 1-3):** Hands-on builder
- Building to learn the system deeply
- Developing quality standards
- Creating reusable components
- Documenting architecture

**Future (Phases 4+):** Architect mode
- Scope and estimate new phases
- Delegate builds to developers
- Manage quality and delivery
- Collect payments and margins

**Why This Progression Makes Sense:**
1. Can't manage what you haven't built
2. Quality standards come from experience
3. Cost estimates accurate only after doing it
4. Developer delegation requires knowing "good"

**Developer Handoff Point:** After Phase 3 delivery (mid-December)
**Margin After Handoff:** 40-50% (dev cost + agency margin)
