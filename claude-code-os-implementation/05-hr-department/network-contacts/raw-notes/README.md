# Raw Networking Notes Directory

## Purpose
This is where you dump raw notes from networking events BEFORE processing them into structured contact records.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. After Networking Event (Same Day)
```bash
# Copy the template
cp TEMPLATE.md YYYY-MM-DD-event-name.md

# Example:
cp TEMPLATE.md 2025-11-25-us-networking.md
```

Open the file and dump all your notes - don't filter, just capture everything while memory is fresh.

### 2. Next Day (Within 24 Hours)
Open `PROCESSING-WORKFLOW.md` and follow the step-by-step guide to process each contact.

### 3. Not Sure How?
See `EXAMPLE-PROCESSED-CONTACT.md` for a full walkthrough showing how raw notes become structured contact records.

## The 24-Hour Rule

**Process within 24 hours or memory fades and contacts are lost forever.**

Set calendar reminder: "Process [Event] contacts" for day after every event.

---

## File Naming Convention

**Unprocessed:** `YYYY-MM-DD-event-name.md`
- Example: `2025-11-25-us-networking.md`
- Example: `2025-11-26-eu-networking.md`
- Example: `2025-12-01-saas-conference.md`

**Processed:** `YYYY-MM-DD-event-name-PROCESSED.md`
- Rename after completing all processing steps
- This signals you're done with this event

---

## What Goes in Raw Notes?

**DO capture:**
- Names (spell them right!)
- What they do
- Pain points mentioned
- Ideas discussed
- Contact info (email, LinkedIn, phone)
- Anything memorable
- Any commitments made

**DON'T worry about:**
- Organization (that's what processing is for)
- Perfect formatting
- Categorization
- Grammar/spelling
- Making sense to others (just for you)

---

## Processing Checklist

For each event file, you're done processing when:
- ✅ Every contact is categorized and filed
- ✅ Index files are updated
- ✅ Follow-up messages are drafted
- ✅ High-priority contacts identified
- ✅ Calendar reminders set
- ✅ File renamed to *-PROCESSED.md

---

## Common Mistakes

❌ Waiting more than 24 hours to process
❌ Skipping contacts because "they probably won't pan out"
❌ Not getting contact info at event
❌ Processing during event instead of capturing
❌ Leaving notes unprocessed forever
❌ Not renaming to PROCESSED when done

✅ Capture fast, process later
✅ Process every single contact
✅ Follow up within 48 hours total
✅ Systematic approach every time

---

## Time Budget

| Event Size | Capture Time | Process Time | Total |
|------------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Small (5-10 people) | 15 min | 30-45 min | ~1 hour |
| Medium (10-20 people) | 30 min | 60-90 min | ~2 hours |
| Large (20+ people) | 45 min | 90-120 min | ~3 hours |

**Worth it?** One good lead generator = $50k+/year revenue
ROI on 2-3 hours = potentially massive

## Need Help?

1. Read `PROCESSING-WORKFLOW.md` for step-by-step guide
2. See `EXAMPLE-PROCESSED-CONTACT.md` for full walkthrough
3. When in doubt, just START - it gets easier with practice

## Success Looks Like

After 3-4 events using this system:
- ✅ No contacts lost
- ✅ Follow-ups happen automatically
- ✅ Network growing systematically
- ✅ Deal flow increasing
- ✅ Takes less time (muscle memory kicks in)
- ✅ You feel in control of your network

**Remember: The money is in the follow-up. Raw notes without processing = $0. Processed contacts with follow-up = $$$.**
