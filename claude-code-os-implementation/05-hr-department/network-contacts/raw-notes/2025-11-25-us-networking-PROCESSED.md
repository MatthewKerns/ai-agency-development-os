Alex Hormozi's ai
* You need to do this this this today

Goal is get cash flow, results that I can have social proof with
* Get people commit to letting me try it out
* Not coming from I'm unsure
* I will get you results, work with you for a month, if I don't get you results I'll work with you until I do

---

### Chris Andrade

* CRM
* What does the client need?
    * Basic CRM
        * The ones that use it have 5 different access points that they need to log into to get that report
* Don't understand how to plug it in on the backend
* If we can rally enough people behind the customer service side of things and approach the client from that angle
* Integrate with an existing one or build your own CRM?
* Basic CRM + inventory system
* Company called Polymath Guild - doing things together is a lot easier
* Will need a voice AI
* Sitting with them in their environment
    * For example owns a printing store, but also does toner, printer, etc. so many things
    * If I had a recorder that could send him a daily report

### Josh Packer

* Said something smart about CRMs - ask Mekaiel later
* Voice agent tech down

### Mekaiel

* Focus on one and refine that thing, deliver results, then explore later
* Trent reply:
    * I always want to offer too much and do too much
    * Hormozi - one person one product one avatar one channel
* AI audit + transformation in 2026
    * People don't have SOPs or documentation or processes in place in the first hand
    * Phase 1 offer of that - audit + refining processes
    * Phase 2 - implementation
* Ken Yung:
    * Sit down with the clients map out what they already have
    * Not only to the client and talk with the Subject Matter Experts
    * Capture their knowledge
    * Diagram and plan out how to structure it
    * Organization process understanding is key to building a knowledge base that is going to be practical for them
    * If they're not using it, its useless
* Chris Andrade:
    * Sitting with them in their environment
    * For example owns a printing store, but also does toner, printer, etc. so many things
    * If I had a recorder that could send him a daily report
* Trent Christopher:
    * Seeing it in reality can be a lot different
    * Interactive way to provide value and extract information
    * Biggest challenge there is providing value without giving them false expectations / the wrong expectations
    * Potentially build them an AI agent that extracts all this information
        * They want value first, then ask for additional context and fill in with questions
* Networks and communities veterans
* Find one specific to AI and automations
