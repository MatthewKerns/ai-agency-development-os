```

## Processing Steps

### Step 1: Clarify What's Needed

From raw notes, unclear:
- Is Trent a potential client or does he do similar work?
- What does "work with them" mean - is he offering or asking?
- Is he a competitor, collaborator, or lead generator?

**Action:** LinkedIn research needed to clarify

**For this example, let's assume:** After LinkedIn research, Trent is a sales consultant who helps businesses but doesn't build AI tools himself. He has clients who need automation = **Lead Generator**

---

### Step 2: Extract Key Details

**Name:** Trent Christopher

**What he does:** Sales consultant, helps businesses with sales systems

**Pain points/needs mentioned:**
- His clients need automated proposal generation
- They need CRM automation (log sales activities easily)
- They want RAG systems (chat with documents)
- Email campaign automation
- Looking for short sprints (2 weeks) with clear results

**His approach:**
- Results-focused
- Commits to working until results achieved
- Wants cash flow and social proof

**Opportunity:**
- He has clients who need AI automation
- Could be a lead generator if we deliver for his clients
- Fast timeline (2 week sprints)

### Step 3: Determine Category

**File:** `lead-generators/by-niche.md` (Professional Services section)

### Step 6: Draft Follow-Up Message

```
Hi Trent,

Great connecting at the US Networking event yesterday. Your approach to guaranteeing results for clients really resonated - that's exactly how I run my AI automation business.

I build AI automations for service businesses (proposal generation, CRM workflow, RAG systems, email campaigns) - the exact projects you mentioned your clients need.

Here's my offer: Let me do a 2-week sprint for one of your clients (you choose which automation they need most). If it doesn't deliver clear results, no charge. When it does, we can discuss a referral partnership.

Would you be open to a quick call this week to discuss?

[Your name]
```

---

### Step 7: Set Follow-Up Reminders

**Calendar reminders:**
- 2025-11-26: Send LinkedIn connection
- 2025-11-27: Send follow-up message
- 2025-12-02: Follow up if no response (5 days later)
- 2025-12-09: Final follow-up if no response (7 days after first follow-up)

---

## Result

**Before:** Messy raw notes, unclear opportunity, no action plan

**After:**
- ✅ Clear contact record with all details
- ✅ Categorized as Lead Generator (Professional Services)
- ✅ Strategic value identified (steady automation project flow)
- ✅ Follow-up plan drafted and scheduled
- ✅ Commission structure considered
- ✅ Positioned for partnership, not one-off
- ✅ Updated in index for quick lookup
- ✅ Action items clear and time-bound

**Time invested:** ~10 minutes
**Potential ROI:** 5-10 clients per year @ $2-8k each = $10-80k/year revenue

---

## Key Lessons from This Example

1. **LinkedIn research is crucial** - Raw notes alone weren't enough to categorize
2. **Think partnership, not transaction** - Positioned as ongoing referral source
3. **Lead with value** - Free pilot removes his risk
4. **Match their language** - He wants "results" and "2-week sprints" - that's what we offer
5. **Fast follow-up matters** - He values speed, so follow up within 24 hours
6. **Update index immediately** - So you can find him later when you need a lead generator in professional services
7. **Set reminders** - Don't rely on memory, calendar everything

---

## Compare: Processed vs. Not Processed

### If you DON'T process:
- Notes sit in notebook
- Memory fades
- You forget key details
- He connects with someone else
- Opportunity lost forever

### If you DO process:
- Clear action plan
- Follow-up happens fast
- Relationship builds systematically
- He becomes referral source
- Potential $50k+/year revenue stream

**The 10 minutes of processing is worth it.**
