## When to Book a Coaching Call

✅ **Book a call when:**
- You have a genuine problem or stopping point
- You've thought through the details yourself
- You need high-level strategic input
- You're at a decision point and need perspective
- You want validation/challenge on your approach

❌ **Don't book a call if:**
- You haven't tried to solve it yourself
- You need tactical help (not strategic)
- You're looking for someone to do the thinking for you
- Question can be answered with research

**Remember:** AAA Network coaching is FREE, but respect their time. Come prepared.

## How to Prepare for a Coaching Call

1. **Define the problem clearly**
   - What's the specific issue?
   - What have you tried?
   - Where are you stuck?

2. **Prepare context**
   - What's your current situation?
   - What are the constraints?
   - What's the goal?

3. **Draft specific questions**
   - Not "what should I do?"
   - Instead "I'm considering X vs Y because of Z, what am I missing?"

4. **Set up Fathom recording**
   - Ensure Fathom is recording
   - You'll get summary + transcript automatically

5. **Take live notes**
   - Key insights as they happen
   - Action items
   - Follow-up questions

## Post-Call Workflow

1. **Download Fathom export** (summary + transcript)
2. **Save to** `raw-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-coach-name.md`
3. **Process within 24 hours** using PROCESSING-WORKFLOW.md
4. **Implement action items** (add to daily planning)
