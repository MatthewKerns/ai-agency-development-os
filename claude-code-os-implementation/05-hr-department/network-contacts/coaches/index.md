## Decision Framework

Before investing in coaching:
1. Is this the bottleneck? (Will coaching fix the constraint?)
2. Can I afford it right now?
3. Do I have time to implement?
4. What's the ROI timeline?
5. Do I need accountability or knowledge?

**Coaching is worth it when:**
- You know WHAT to do but need accountability
- You're stuck and need outside perspective
- ROI timeline is clear and reasonable
- It solves current bottleneck

**Coaching is NOT worth it when:**
- You're avoiding doing the work
- You don't have time to implement
- You just want motivation
- The constraint is somewhere else
