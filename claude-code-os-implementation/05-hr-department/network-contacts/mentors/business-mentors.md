### Mekaiel
**Met:** 2025-11-25 at US Networking Event
**Contact:** [LinkedIn/Email - need to get]
**Location:** [City/Country - need to get]

**Their Background:**
- Working on AI audit + transformation offering for 2026
- Strategic thinker focused on process-first approach
- Understands agency model and focus principles

**Expertise Areas:**
- AI audit approach (assessment before implementation)
- Process documentation and SOP development
- Strategic focus ("Focus on one and refine that thing, deliver results, then explore later")
- Knowledge capture from subject matter experts
- Organization process understanding
- Building practical knowledge bases that clients actually use

**What They've Done:**
- Developing 2-phase AI transformation offering:
  - Phase 1: Audit + refining processes (identifies gaps in SOPs/documentation)
  - Phase 2: Implementation (build on documented processes)
- Strategic advisor role at US Networking event
- Helped Trent with focus issue (Hormozi model: one person, one product, one avatar, one channel)

**What They Can Help You With:**
- **AI audit approach:** How to structure audit-first engagements
- **Process-first methodology:** Documenting before automating
- **Strategic focus:** Avoiding "offer too much" trap
- **Knowledge capture:** Working with subject matter experts to extract knowledge
- **Practical knowledge base design:** Building systems clients actually use (not useless)
- **Client environment immersion:** Sitting with clients in their environment to understand reality
- **Phase-based project structure:** Audit → Refine → Implement

**Mentorship Style:**
- Strategic/frameworks-driven
- Direct, focused advice ("Focus on one thing")
- Collaborative discussion style (participates in group conversations)
- Principle-based thinking (Hormozi model, etc.)

**Access:**
- **Availability:** Moderate - attends US Networking events weekly
- **Cost:** Free / Reciprocal (networking context)
- **Best way to reach:** At US Networking events, [LinkedIn/Email TBD]

**Relationship Status:** Prospective
- **Last Contact:** 2025-11-25 (met at event)
- **Connection Strength:** Just met
- **Value Exchanged:** None yet, but shared valuable strategic insights in group

**Key Insights Shared:**
- **On focus:** "Focus on one and refine that thing, deliver results, then explore later"
- **On AI audits:** "People don't have SOPs or documentation or processes in first place" → Phase 1 is audit + refining
- **On knowledge capture (via Ken Yung):**
  - Sit down with clients, map what they have
  - Talk to Subject Matter Experts, not just the client
  - Capture their knowledge
  - Diagram and plan structure
  - "Organization process understanding is key to building knowledge base that is practical"
  - "If they're not using it, it's useless"
- **On reality vs. expectations (via Trent):**
  - "Seeing it in reality can be a lot different"
  - Interactive way to provide value and extract information
  - Challenge: providing value without false expectations
  - Idea: Build AI agent that extracts information ("they want value first, then ask for context")
- **Strategic alignment:** Networks and communities for veterans, find AI/automation specific ones

**When to Reach Out:**
- When structuring AI audit offering
- When deciding how to phase projects (audit vs. implementation)
- When stuck on strategic focus (trying to do too much)

- Potential collaboration: He audits → You implement
- Both benefit: He gets implementation partner, you get scoped projects
- Market validation: Scott (EU) already doing this model successfully (£8k deals)
