# AI/Automation Agency Contact Tracking Focus

## Why This Matters

For an AI automation agency, knowing someone builds "voice agents" or specializes in "n8n workflows" is MORE valuable than knowing they code in Python or React.

**Old approach (traditional dev agency):** Track tech stack (React, Node.js, Python)
**New approach (AI automation agency):** Track automation types and platforms

---

## What We Track Now

### 1. Automation Types (What they build)
- Voice agents / AI voice systems

### 2. Platforms/Tools (What they use)

### 3. Lead Generation Tactics (How they get clients)

**Ask about:**
- What platforms do you use? (n8n, Make, etc.)
- What types of automations do you build?
- What specific projects have you done?
- How do you get clients?

### Step 2: Extract Details (Processing)
**Focus on:**
- Automation types (not tech stack)
- Platform expertise (not programming languages)
- Specializations ("voice agent guy", "CRM expert")
- Lead gen tactics (if lead generator)

### Step 3: Categorize
**Add to index under:**
- By Automation Type
- By Platform
- By Lead Gen Tactics (for lead generators)

## Why This Works Better

**Traditional approach:**
- "He codes in Python" → So what? Lots of people code in Python

**AI Automation approach:**
- "He specializes in voice agents with 3 months experience" → Perfect! Call him when we get voice agent work

**The difference:**
- Tech stack = generic
- Automation specialization = actionable

2. **Add to indexes under:**
   - Automation type (not tech stack)
   - Platform (if they specialize)
