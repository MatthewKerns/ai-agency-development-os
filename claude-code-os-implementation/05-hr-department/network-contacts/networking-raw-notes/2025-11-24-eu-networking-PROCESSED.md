    * Advertising agencies
    * VoiceOver agencies

    * Not trying to sell something, really just trying to find out what it is
    * Getting better at doing discovery calls itself
    * Trying to not go down a development rabbit hole, loves doing that on n8n

* Network been pushing him to make an avatar and do kids music
    * Can combine to faceless YouTube channel
* Making content insights:
    * If making content showing builds you're targeting other builders
    * If making content that's going to attract more business owners interested in the AI space - what kind of content are you creating?
        * Document the process of building
        * Film yourself while you do the mundane stuff

## Additional Notes

### Rubric Prompt Example (shared in chat)

"Create an SOP for the a bank service request process. Before you begin, create an internal rubric with criteria for the most detailed, thorough and fair service request process. Then use this rubric to internally iterate the outline until your response scores 10/10"

(Note: This is just an example, you will need to change the 'bank' to whatever and the "service request" to something else)
