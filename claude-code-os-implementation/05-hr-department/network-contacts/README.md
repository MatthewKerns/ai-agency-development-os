## Relationship Status Tracking

Every contact has a **Relationship Status** field to track where they are in your pipeline:

| Status | Definition | Next Action |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Prospective** | Not yet contacted, preparing message | Draft outreach message |
| **Contacted** | Reached out, awaiting response | Follow up if no response in 3-5 days |
| **Active Conversation** | Engaging back and forth | Keep conversation moving |
| **Actively Working With** | Currently doing projects together | Maintain relationship, track performance |
| **Warm/Available** | Good relationship, available when needed | Check in monthly/quarterly |
| **Inactive/Dormant** | Haven't spoken in 3+ months | Reactivation campaign |
| **Not Interested** | Declined or not a fit | Archive, revisit in 6-12 months |

**Usage:**
- Update status whenever relationship changes
- Use index files to see all contacts at each stage
- Focus activation efforts on "Prospective" and "Contacted" stages

## Weekly Workflow

### After Every Networking Event (Use the Funnel!)

1. **Same Day: Capture Raw Notes**
   - Create file: `raw-notes/YYYY-MM-DD-event-name.md`
   - Use the TEMPLATE.md
   - Dump everything - names, pain points, ideas discussed
   - Don't filter, just capture

2. **Next Day (Within 24 Hours): Process**
   - Follow `raw-notes/PROCESSING-WORKFLOW.md` step-by-step
   - Categorize each contact:
     - Developers → `developers/[level].md`
     - Potential sales partners → `lead-generators/by-niche.md` or `by-network.md`
     - Mentors → `mentors/[type].md`
     - Content creators → `content-creators/by-expertise.md`
     - Everyone else → `general-contacts.md`
   - Update index files for quick lookup
   - Draft follow-up messages for high-priority contacts
   - Mark raw notes file as PROCESSED

3. **2 Days After Event: Execute Follow-Ups**
   - Send personalized connection messages
   - Update contacts to "Contacted" status
   - Set follow-up reminders (3-5 days if no response)

4. **Weekly: Review & Maintain**
   - Check pending follow-ups
   - Follow up with non-responders
   - Move conversations forward
   - Update relationship statuses
   - Activate high-value relationships
