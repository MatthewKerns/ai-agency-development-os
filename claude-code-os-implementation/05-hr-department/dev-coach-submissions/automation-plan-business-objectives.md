## Executive Summary

**Submitter:** Matthew (Architect, iCodeMyBusiness Agency)

**Purpose:** Present automation roadmap and business objectives for coaching on prioritization, scoping, and pricing strategy

**OBG (One Big Goal):** $50k/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months

**Current State:**
- Agency formed with 4 equity partners
- First client project invoiced ($500, awaiting payment)
- Multiple projects in pipeline
- Need to scale from builder to architect

**Coaching Request:**
- Validate automation priorities
- Learn pricing/scoping frameworks
- Get guidance on build vs delegate decisions
- Understand margin protection strategies

---

## Business Context

### The Agency Model

**iCodeMyBusiness LLC**

**Equity Partners (Trial Run Structure):**
1. **Mekaiel** - Sales, systems, onboarding, content, video editing connections
2. **Chris** - Sales, systems, onboarding, lead lists
3. **Trent** - Software dev, dev systems, robotics, developer hiring/assessment
4. **Matthew (Me)** - Software dev, company OS, agency building, prototyping

**Revenue Split:** Project-by-project equity split (testing partnership before long-term commitment)

### The Agency Flow

```
1. Discovery Call (Sales team) → $200-500/hr billable
2. Prototype (Matthew) → Prove value, get buy-in
3. Scope & Price (Matthew) → Using pricing framework
4. Developer Selection (Trent) → Find, evaluate, onboard developers
5. Delivery Management (Matthew/Trent) → Manage to completion
6. Payment Collection (Sales team) → Cash in bank
```

**Value Proposition:**
- Fast prototyping (prove value quickly)
- Transparent scoping
- Professional delivery
- Ongoing support

### Current Role: Builder → Architect Transition

**Current Phase (Nov-Dec):** Hands-on Builder
- Deliver client projects myself
- Learn systems deeply
- Develop quality standards
- Document what works

**Future Phase (Jan+):** The Architect
- Scope and price with confidence
- Delegate to developers
- Manage quality and delivery
- Protect margins
- Train developers

**Rationale:** Can't manage what I haven't built. Need to understand costs, quality, and pitfalls before delegating.

## The OBG: $50k/month Revenue

### Path to $50k/month

| Revenue Source | Target/Month | Strategy |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Client projects (with margin) | $30-40k | Core business |
| Diagnostic calls ($200-500/hr) | $5-10k | Billable discovery |
| Developer Academy (future) | $5-10k | Long-term moat |
| **TOTAL** | **$40-60k** | Multiple streams |

### Current Pipeline

| Project | Stage | Value | Probability | Timeline |
|---------|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| Trevor P1 | Invoiced | $500 | 95% | Payment expected Dec 2-3 |
| Trevor P2-5 | Scoped | $3,500 | 80% | Dec-Jan progressive |
| Christian/Turtle Rescue | Discovery | $3-5k | 70% | Scoping this week |
| LinkedIn Automation | Internal | $2-3k | 60% | Building this week |
| Equity Partners Client List | Discovery | $10-20k | 50% | Dec discovery sessions |

**Near-term Pipeline:** $19-31k
**Current Monthly Run Rate:** ~$1-2k
**Gap to OBG:** Need to close $48-49k/month more

### Breaking Constraint Analysis

**Current Bottleneck:** Proposal generation and pricing
- Too slow (2-4 hours per proposal)
- Inconsistent pricing (risk to margins)
- Can't delegate (no framework)
- Limits deal velocity

**Solution:** Proposal generator with pricing framework
**Impact:** 10x proposal capacity, consistent margins, delegate to sales team

**Second Constraint:** Meeting tracking and follow-up
- Action items get missed
- Data from meetings lost
- No systematic client discovery

**Solution:** Fathom OS integration
**Impact:** Zero manual note-taking, automatic action item tracking, systematic data capture

**Third Constraint:** Developer pipeline
- Can't scale without developers
- No systematic recruiting
- No quality assessment framework

**Solution:** Developer Academy + hiring system
**Impact:** Pipeline of pre-trained, pre-vetted developers

## Build vs Delegate Framework

### When to Build In-House (Matthew)

**Criteria:**
1. ✅ First time building this type of system
2. ✅ Need to learn it deeply to manage others
3. ✅ Develop quality standards
4. ✅ Create reusable components
5. ✅ Small scope (<30 hours)
6. ✅ High strategic value

**Examples:**
- Fathom integration (first time, high strategic value)
- Proposal generator MVP (need to learn pricing framework)
- LinkedIn automation prototype (small scope, reusable)

### When to Delegate to Developer

**Criteria:**
1. ✅ Already built similar system before
2. ✅ Large scope (>30 hours)
3. ✅ Well-defined requirements
4. ✅ Can create quality assessment
5. ✅ Developer cost + margin < opportunity cost
6. ✅ Don't need to learn the internals

**Examples:**
- Trevor phases 4-5 (already built 1-3)
- Proposal generator full build (after MVP)
- Client projects where requirements are clear

## Pricing Strategy Questions

### 1. Fixed Price vs Cost-Plus

**When should I use each model?**

**Fixed Price:**
- Pros: Higher perceived value, margin opportunity
- Cons: Risk if scope expands, need accurate estimation
- Best for: Well-defined projects, proven solutions

**Cost-Plus:**
- Pros: Transparent, lower risk, builds trust
- Cons: Visible margins, less profit opportunity
- Best for: Complex projects, new solutions, ongoing work

**Hybrid:**
- Discovery/scoping: Fixed
- Development: Cost-plus
- Best of both worlds?

**QUESTION:** Which model do you recommend for automation projects?

### 2. Margin Targets

**Current Margins:**
- Self-built projects: 100% (opportunity cost only)
- Developer-delegated: 30-80% (varies widely)

**Industry Standard:** 30-50% for agency work

**QUESTION:** What's a reasonable margin target for:
- Discovery calls?
- Prototype builds?
- Developer-managed projects?
- Ongoing support/maintenance?

### 3. Component Pricing

**Should I price by:**
- Components (Fathom integration = $X, Proposal engine = $Y)?
- Hours (Developer hours × rate + margin)?
- Value (Client ROI × percentage)?
- Flat rate (This type of project = $Z)?

**QUESTION:** How do you approach component-based pricing?

### 4. Payment Milestones

**Options:**
- 50/50 (upfront / delivery)
- Thirds (upfront / mid / delivery)
- Phased ($X per phase delivered)

**QUESTION:** What payment structure protects cash flow while building client confidence?

---

## Key Coaching Questions

### Strategic Direction

1. **Build vs Delegate:** Should I build Fathom + LinkedIn myself or hire developer now?
2. **Phased Delivery:** Is Trevor's phased approach ($500 → $500 → $1000 → ...) optimal?
3. **Proposal Generator:** Build in-house or delegate? Phased approach?
4. **Time Allocation:** How much time building vs scoping/selling?

### Pricing & Scoping

5. **Christian/Turtle Project:** How should I price the Fathom integration for them?
6. **LinkedIn Automation:** One-time fee or recurring service model?
7. **Margin Protection:** How to prevent scope creep from eating margins?
8. **Risk Pricing:** What percentage buffer for unknowns?

### Estimation

9. **Time Estimates:** How to estimate development time accurately?
10. **Component Breakdown:** Is component-based estimation helpful or overkill?
11. **Developer Rates:** How to evaluate if developer estimates are realistic?

### Agency Operations

12. **Quality Standards:** How to define "good enough" for delegation?
13. **Developer Management:** What margin is fair on developer cost?
14. **Equity Partner Splits:** How to split revenue fairly on projects?
