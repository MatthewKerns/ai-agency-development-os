# AI Agency Development OS

## Purpose
Claude Code OS for running an AI automation agency. The operator is the **Architect** - not a coder-for-hire, but the strategic leader who diagnoses, prototypes, scopes, prices, delegates, and manages.

## OBG: $50k/month revenue for 3+ consecutive months

After achieving this, scale with YouTube content and inbound lead flow.

## The 13 Principles (Foundation)

### Category 1: Foundation Philosophy
1. **Entropy Principle** - Forget perfect. It will be messy. OK to suck at 99% as long as you nail the ONE that matters.
2. **No Friction = Sustainable Discipline** - Remove friction. High friction kills discipline.
3. **Spartan Rule** - Lean, one obsession, brutal elimination. Focus on ONE thing.

### Category 2: Execution Mechanics
4. **Breaking Constraint Principle** - Find the bottleneck, remove it, load the system hard.
5. **Today Ignore Tomorrow's Problems** - Don't burn mental power on problems that may never happen.
6. **Input Over Output** - Control and measure inputs. Right inputs → right outputs.
7. **Do The Work** - Whatever the friction, motivation, or mood.

### Category 3: Strategic Layer
8. **Tactical vs Strategic Focus** - Strategic focus is mandatory. Tactical can be parallel.
9. **Third I Principle** - Measure inputs/activity/effort objectively.
10. **Power of Routine** - Fast morning planning, weekly/monthly planning, evening assessments.

### Category 4: Energy Boosters
11. **Strategic Alignment Prevents Wasted Work** - Every hour feels productive when aligned.
12. **Mind Peace** - Continuity, no lost work, no forgotten projects.
13. **Self-Discipline = Freedom** - Systems reduce friction, making discipline easier.

## Your Role: The Architect

| You ARE | You are NOT |
|---------|-------------|
| Diagnoser of business problems | A coder-for-hire |
| Prototyper (vibe coding) | A freelancer |
| Scoper and estimator | Someone who builds everything |
| Developer evaluator | Someone who grinds production |
| Margin protector | A service monkey |
| Quality enforcer | |
| Developer trainer | |

**Your value = knowing what code is needed, who should build it, what it should cost, and ensuring it's done right.**

---

## Agency Structure

### Linh (Sales + Relationships)
- Finds businesses, opens doors
- Builds trust, offers diagnostic calls
- Loops you in when needed
- Manages client relationships

### Mikael (Outbound + Biz Dev)
- Runs outreach, finds operators
- Builds relationships
- Closes smaller deals
- Supports operations

### You (Architect + Estimator + Technical Strategist)
- Diagnose problems
- Prototype solutions (vibe coding)
- Scope and estimate projects
- Recruit and evaluate developers
- Price with margin protection
- Manage delivery and quality
- Train developers (Developer Academy)

---

## The Agency Flow

```
1. Linh/Mikael bring lead
   ↓
2. You run diagnostic call (BILLABLE: $200-500/hr)
   ↓
3. You vibe code a prototype
   ↓
4. Client says YES → You scope and price
   ↓
5. You find/evaluate developer
   ↓
6. You add margin (dev cost + your margin + sales fee)
   ↓
7. You manage delivery to completion
   ↓
8. Collect payment → Repeat
```

## Priority Hierarchy

| Priority | Focus | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| P0 | Revenue (close deals, deliver, collect) | ACTIVE |
| P1 | Agency infrastructure (roles, splits, templates) | ACTIVE |
| P2 | Developer pipeline (recruit, evaluate) | Building |
| P3 | Developer Academy (long-term moat) | Foundation |
| P4 | Credibility assets (demos that close deals) | As needed |
| P5 | Content/inbound scaling | DEFERRED until OBG |

---

## Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/daily-assessment [context]` | End of day productivity score |
| `/weekly-review [context]` | Weekly summary and planning |
| `/project-status` | Quick view of all projects |

---

## Quick Reference

| User Request | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| "Plan my day" | Generate daily roadmap |
| "Update objectives" | Edit strategic-objectives file |
| "Project status" | Run `/project-status` |
| "Daily assessment" | Run `/daily-assessment` |

| Trevor | Brand consultation automation | Delivery |

---

## Key Reminders

1. **Charge for diagnostic calls** - $200-500/hr, no free discovery
2. **Prototype, don't build production** - Vibe code to validate
3. **Delegate production builds** - Recruit developers
4. **Protect margins** - Dev cost + your margin + sales fee
5. **Revenue first** - Everything else is secondary until $50k/mo × 3 months

---

## The Simple Rule

```
You are the Architect, not the builder.
Diagnose → Prototype → Scope → Price → Delegate → Manage → Collect
$50k/mo × 3 months → THEN scale with content.
```
